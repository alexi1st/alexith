                <p>Faced with a bored, lonely, unemployed type of summer vibe? Already used up all of your vacation points too early on 
                    in the summer and are stuck at home with nothing else to do? Well, I suffered that same fate. I was searching desperately 
                    for a way out — something to fulfill that lackluster part of my routine. Sure, a job application could've worked and kept me busy,
                     but instead I decided to turn to the one game I knew best. <strong>Roblox.</strong></p>
                <img src="https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47252.13510798883386282.a1e5df65-8dd7-427c-9da9-506afa37b254.f4132380-deee-4518-8bbd-2a9b540046f3?mode=scale&q=90&h=1080&w=1920" width="550px" height="300px" class="img-right">
        
                <p>
                Roblox offers a wide variety of games. Many claim that there's a game for everybody on Roblox. However, at the time, it felt helpless. Yeah, 
                I enjoyed playing on Bloxburg and admiring the new map, but eventually I got bored of building. I even grew a prosperous garden on the hit 
                game "Grow a Garden" — but alas, like clockwork, I can never just be a casual player on anything and I burnt myself out by playing that game too much. 
                On a particularly desperate night, I scrolled through various games. Voice chat games were fun, but I can only exert so much energy to talking 
                to others before feeling tired of the same conversations. Mini-game games were fun, but only after two rounds. But little did I know, I would 
                stumble upon one of the simplest concepts of games — a jigsaw puzzle game!
                </p>
                <p>
                I was introduced to the magic of "Puzzle Cabin". Going in I had minimal expectations. I had already been disappointed far too many times to count from the previous
                15 games I swore would cure my boredom, and at this point, I wasn't even remotely curious about what puzzles this cabin had to offer. I just wanted to see what it was. 
                Perhaps it would be worth my time, and if it wasn't, I'd be out in less than five minutes.<br><br>

                Whenever I joined the game, my first impression was immediately how understimulating the environment was.
                I had been so used to playing games that were full of colorful icons with countdowns while upbeat tunes by Kevin Macleod played loudly in the background.
                This game that I had stumbled upon was nothing like I'd ever known. Instead, it was bare of icons and provided little context while classical music played quietly in the back.
                With its calming nature, I didn't feel intrigued by the the lonesome cabin in the distance. I approached it sincerely, and to my surprise, was met with a big table with 
                others sitting around it. There was silence. Despite the voice-chat feature, nobody spoke. Nobody even typed in the chat. I, unknown of just how silent its nature was, tried to strike up a 
                conversation. I spoke "hi" into my mic and took a seat at the table. While I was not met with the voice of another player, I was instead met with a pop-up 
                consisting of a variety of pictures from animals, scenery, food, etc. Beautifully photographed pictures right at my fingertips — how could I ever 
                choose? As a rather indecisive being, it took a few minutes of scrolling through the catalog until I locked in on a photograph of a corgi. It was reminiscent of
                a friend's dog, so I clicked on it and had to choose a puzzle difficulty. I went with one of the easier modes. I went through the motions of doing a puzzle:
                identifying what a piece was, finding its exact location in the reference, putting it together — you know how it goes. I finished it and it was fun. 
                So I did another one. And another. All in rather easy game modes.</p>

                Apologies, I've probably already bored you out. I'll spare you the details of how I jumped into higher difficulties and any other specifics for now. My anecdote may seem
                insignificant, but I share it with you because I want you to realize just how unsuspecting I was at my initial point of discovery. There's almost a beauty whenever you go into an adventure
                blissfully unaware at how something seemingly insignificant can evolve into a driving factor of your day. What's important to 
                me now is that I share with you the impact this particular game has had on me; why it's such a big deal and why I keep returning to it.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3 class="a-header">Impact</h3>
                <p>
                For one thing, doing jigsaw puzzles on Roblox seems like a stupid concept. There's already other websites, standalone games, and especially
                REALITY that provide spaces to puzzle — and of all of those mediums I choose ROBLOX? Well, yes! Roblox makes the experience much more immersive if doing puzzles 
                in real life isn't as attainable or ideal for you. Why exactly? Well, you  have the abiltiy to move your avatar throughout the game. You can freely roam the map, take a seat,
                go upstairs to the second level of the cabin, kick a ball into a goal, and so much more. Perhaps these features are questionable to you — "Are we still talking about a puzzle
                game anymore?" But these are such small details, and in those other jigsaw games/websites, you don't get this benefit. 
                You can't sit down as an avatar, in a server, with your friends, talk to them, and do your own puzzles. You just can't, because in the context of being 
                a standalone jigsaw game, that's just not a feature developers would consider. There's no point of avatars, because you have the expectation of playing and solving alone.
                But this is <em>Roblox</em> we're talking about, which is the best context and justification for these experiences to exist.<br><br>

                One of the most significant characteristics of this game that I clocked after finishing my first puzzle is that "Puzzle Cabin" is the PERFECT game for parallel
                playing. You're working solo, on your own puzzle, no competition between others, BUT you still get to sit in a server alongside your peers. It's parallel 
                playing to a T — and that's something I personally find beautiful. The voice chat feature, while rarely used, is a nice touch and is actually one of the main 
                reasons why I yearned for too long that I had someone to parallel play this game with. Now, do I wish there was a multiplayer aspect to making the puzzles? Yes, I honestly do, but as of right now I love
                "Puzzle Cabin" for what it is and what it provides for me as a soloist.
                </p>
                <p>
                After my first time playing "Puzzle Cabin", I returned humbly every day and did a puzzle or two (maybe even three...or four... sometimes five) with time intervals in between. I came back excited 
                after each interval — still full with a craving for those puzzle pieces. It didn't take long until I only committed myself to the highest "NIGHTMARE" difficulty of these puzzles. A 
                whopping 300 pieces! When I first started doing the nightmare puzzles, it took me and hour to an hour and a half to complete. That's a rather long commitment to most, but I'm 
                privileged (unemployed) enough to devote large blocks of my time like that. As I continued to indulge myself in the peaceful construction of these little pieces, I pushed myself to bring down my average puzzle
                time with each new picture I did. Now, I felt even more fulfilled whenever I was playing this game I was working towards a goal.

                <p>
                Now, as a repeat-offender of burning myself out on games by playing too much, "Puzzle Cabin" and its simplicity makes this issue so easy to avoid. It is literally just the nature of puzzles, honestly. After finishing a 
                NIGHTMARE puzzle, I get the gratification of putting in that last piece and watching the puzzle do its flipping animation. Of course, since an hour or so has passed, 
                I do tend to leave drained so I log off, but I leave with satisfaction and fulfillment. I take a break, and if the craving comes back later that day, I return. If not, 
                it'll kick in tomorrow morning. The act of doing one of these puzzles is tiring, but it's not a bad kind of tiring. Unlike most, this mental draining between me and 
                doing puzzles is healthier for the relationship. The time where I am not doing a puzzle is where the "distance makes the heart grow fonder" kicks in. Maybe it sounds 
                strange to defend this type of relationship, but it is very important that the dopamine you get from puzzle cabin is regulated so you don't overexert and play yourself 
                out of interest.    
                </p>

                Perhaps I'm lame for feeling so strongly over this puzzle game. I wouldn't blame you if you didn't give two effs about what I had to say. Maybe this whole "Puzzle Cabin"
                is a phase of mine or simply just another hyperfixation and game to burn myself out on — albeit slowly. If that's the case, maybe I'll return in months to come and admit 
                it, but for now, "Puzzle Cabin" is what completes me. The same way I complete those puzzles, is the same way it completes me. I wont forget the joys of scrolling through 
                royalty-free photo websites and downloading photos I deemed worthy of doing on Puzzle Cabin. The first time I had did that, my eyes watered at how happy I was in doing so. 
                The privilege of turning beautiful photos possessing yogurt and fruit into a puzzle was perfection. Things make sense now, and I am beginning to recognize the small aspects 
                of life that make everything worth it. To Puzzle Cabin, my dearest, thank you for reminding me that this. was. the. whole. point. &lt;3
