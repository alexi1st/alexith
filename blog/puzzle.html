        <h2>Top 10 Puzzle Cabin Moments</h2>
            <p><strong>MY NAME IS ALEXIS</strong> and I am an avid puzzle lover. I may not have the best credentials or the longest experience,
        but trust me, I know ball.<br><br>For quite some time, I was doing at least <em>one</em> 300 pc puzzle every single day for
        like, two, almost three, months straight. Not to mention, I was doing like, on a GOOD DAY, upmost to <em>5 puzzles</em>.
        Babs I was INNITTT. Okay, mate? And not to mention, I've done 2 1000pc puzzles this summer.<br><br>
        So if you think about it, I did 173 300 pc puzzles. 173 x 300 is <strong>51,900.</strong> Plus the additional 2000 pieces from the physical
        puzzles, I handled an estimated <strong><em>53,900</em></strong> pieces of puzzles this summer. Some physical, most digital.
        My average time on a <strong>NIGHTMARE</strong> puzzle in puzzle cabin is <em>53 minutes</em>. However, it wasn't always that way.<br><br>
        Throughout the summer, my daily puzzles were not only a testament of my devotion to puzzling, but also a journey of pushing myself
        harder and harder to decrease my average puzzle time. I remember working my way down from a pathetic <strong>1 hr 16 min</strong>. It
        was a lot of stress, pressure, and frustration--but amidst it all, it was truly resilience, patience, and focus that got me through it.<br><br>
        Mane what am I even saying. Basically, I played and did A LOT of puzzles on puzzle cabin last summer. So I'm qualified to give my say on what
        the top puzzles I did this summer were. OK? I share now</p>
        <div>
        <h3>TOP TEN PUZZLE CABIN PUZZLES I'VE DONE...</h3>
          <ol reversed start="10">
            <li>
                <h3>Macarons</h3><br>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-0f3645abac4ad4b543e36bc8658469b1/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>A macarons puzzle needed a place on here. Every single macaron one was fun, easy,<br>
                    stress-free, and fulfilling. So shoutout to the macarons, you made it on here, but<br>
                they barely made it because aesthetically, they are not as pleasing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Matcha Tea</h3>
                <a href="https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/126554907206562?assetType=Decal&externalSource=www" target="_blank"><img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-688e6d9bd6fd78fb9bb36e05a48c2f9d/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" /></a>
                    <p>I had to put this one on here because I remember when I first found this photo,<br>
                    I was very excited to do it as a puzzle. I do remember feeling very satisfied. Even<br>
                though I hate doing greenery, this one wasn't memorably difficult with its leaves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fun Breakfast Spread</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-9c0bbb4010962184811fe98dbc0092b2/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>This one feels a bit like an outlier on this list. In terms of aesthetics, this<br>
                        one is not necessarily my ideal photo for a puzzle. However, I just remember<br>
                        this one in particular being quite enjoyable to do because of the different stuff.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Apple Cinnamon</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-b7793d85aa2a43481e01172688b4d063/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>This one was really memorable for me. It was good vibes doing this one. It was<br>
                    also stress free and simple, plus the star-cut apple slices are really doing it<br>
                for me. This was one of the first puzzles I got a lower time of ~39 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Gurt: Yo</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-b1f3249af4b16436215cf5b530411147/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>With the amount of yogurt/smoodie/acai bowl images I downloaded, they needed to make<br>
                    this list. Not only is there 4 bowls (variety), but the toppings are aesthetically<br>
                    pleasing as well. The cloth was annoying to do but the bowls made it worth it.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Artistic Gurt</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-9fb98d4e533671c657b02579bb1ca675/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>Another bowl makes it onto this list. This one in particular earns its place<br>
                    because this yogurt bowl (?) presentation is just stellar and unforgettable. I<br>
                really like the artistic tray, and the variety and aesthetic of the toppings are unmatched.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Diverse Donut Display</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-4190e71a96a4f2e4c84ae7b0be5a21d5/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>If there's one thing I fw in a puzzle, it's VARIETY. I like photos that<br>
                    are centered around one specific thing (in this one it's donuts), but it shows<br>
                us a diverse range of said thing. I like it. This made me realize why DEI matters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Duck Face Bread</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-be4b883a70f75f8f363e14d7c55852e3/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>I remember this photo so fondly because this photo with its duck-face bread<br>
                    really made me excited to do this puzzle. The aesthetics of this one are simple--<br>
                neutrals but with that vibrancy of the green slice and the green background. It's a<br>
            perfect mix with these chunky breads.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Circular Matcha Sweets Display</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-972afcccd83a0a1c055853007b62f475/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>I wont' lie, I was skeptical of putting this one on here--let alone this high<br>
                    on the list. My justification on this one is it was very fun finding the pieces<br>
                that make up the circular display. They're the easiest parts to differentiate, and it<br>
            was rewarding to piece them to together. Not to mention, building the display allowed it<br>
            to be sort of a "bridge" between all the other pieces so they'd all connect,,, if you know<br>
            what I mean. But yeah, the little treats also provide me with that much loved variety I<br>
            talk so much about!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Purple Sweet Stimulation Station</h3>
                <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-102ee355210d537364b599319a71c839/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>THIS PUZZLE. TAKES. THE CAKE. Okay, maybe a controversial pick (honestly I<br>
                    think my entire list is), but let me justify.<br><br>
                    When it comes to puzzles of this scale (big scene, small details), it's very<br>
                    easy to get overwhelmed and frustrated when you can't finish it before your<br>
                "average time". However, this one in particular was just so fun to do. Although<br>
                everything is purple and at the start it all starts to just blend together,<br>
                once you commit yourself to it, you'll find that these small detailed pieces are<br>
                must easier to understand than you thought. It's actually <em>quite</em> easy and<br>
                enjoyable to piece the detailed pieces together compared to if you were piecing parts<br>
                that make up a bigger subject of a puzzle, since all pieces will be less clarifying<br>
                and essentially look the same.<br><br>
                Anyways, <em>THAT</em> is my reasoning behind this puzzle. I enjoyed this one a lot,<br>
                and this made me realize the art in these "smaller detail, but bigger picture" puzzles.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Welp, that pretty much concludes my list for my <strong>Top 10 Puzzle Cabin Puzzles</strong>. Maybe you don't agree<br>
            with some of these or maybe you do. Maybe you can't understand why I would make this list. Quite frankly, I don't know why<br>
            I made this either. But if I had a nickel for everytime I made an "blog" for Puzzle Cabin, I'd have two nickels. Which<br>
            might be a world record because I haven't seen any Puzzle Cabin blog that wasn't by me.<br><br>
            Comment down below in the non-existent comment section what you thought about this. Let me know what puzzles you enjoyed<br>
            doing or anything else puzzle related.<br><br></p>

        <h4>Honorable Mention</h4>
          <img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/180DAY-fd1b7754a329e2471e615b09749697ba/150/150/Image/Webp/noFilter" width="350" height="250" />
                    <p>A <strong>Flags of the World</strong> puzzle is my ideal puzzle. I've probably done this<br>
                    one like at least 5 times. It usually takes over an hour to finish, but the main reason I keep<br>
                    going back to it is to figure out the best strats to finish it quicker. So yeah, honorable<br>
                    mention right here.<br><br><br></p>
