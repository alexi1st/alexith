              <p>   I am Alexis Mabbun and I am a 19 year old with some interest in life. My consumerist tendencies
                currently lie in things like LPS, Fugglers, and puzzles. I enjoy some other things in life like
                Roblox (which actually is and was my life), drawing (lukewarmly), and thinker lifestyle (Literally not out of my free will tho).
                There's a lot of stuff I want to get better at but I definitely have issue (more than one) so it will probably remain a want until further commitment (not happening. Remember I have issue >1).
                I currently go to MIT (of the South) and I am majoring in Design (but loosely). Life
                is something. Artists that I enjoy are Lorde Ya Ya, Frank Ocean, Matt Maltese, and Roy Blair.<br><br>
                    I am a funny person and enjoy a laugh so I like a lot of sitcom like Community and Superstore.
                And again, I am quite a thinker of the world so I like thought-provoking stuff like Black Mirror too. My favorite movies are 
                <em>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</em> and <em>Interstellar.</em> A list that surprised me
                even though I claimed I was never a fan of Sci-fi! LOL! Just proof that the world is unexpected And
                ever so changing and you really never know what to expect so you should always be prepared for when Life
                does not go your way and when things are not what you expect. #TRUTH (they call me the truth-myser)<br><br>
                    I enjoy pondersome moments and solitude, but if you ever have a ponderful urge but do not want
                to satisfy it alone, I am always up for the occasion, so please just let me know and I will RSVP for it.
